DNN_Data_2017_2021_MIN.csv is the dataset that was used to trained and test the models

DNNModel is a requirement file that is necessary in order to train the Neural Network model
it is called in NB_03_Deep_Learning_2.ipynb

NB_03_Deep_Learning_2.ipynb contains all the code for the development of the Neural Network model

RF_03_Machine_Learning.ipynb contains all the code for the development of the Random Forest and the Logistic Regression models
